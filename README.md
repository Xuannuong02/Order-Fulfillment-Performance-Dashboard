## üìä Project: Order Fulfillment Performance Dashboard
## üè¢ Domain: Retail / FMCG ‚Äì Order & Sales Monitoring
## üõ† Tools: Power BI, DAX, Data Modeling

### 1. Business Problem

Order fulfillment is a key KPI for retailers. Incomplete (partial) and cancelled orders directly impact revenue, operations, and customer satisfaction. Management required a centralized dashboard to:

Monitor In Full vs Partial vs Cancelled Orders.

Track order quantity and revenue impact.

Identify top customers, channels, and cancellation reasons.

Enable MTD and YTD comparisons.

### 2. Data Sources & Modeling

Sales Orders Table: order ID, customer, status, amount, channel, warehouse.

Customer & Group Tables: customer hierarchy, group name.

Calendar Table: for time intelligence (YTD, MTD).

Reference Tables: cancellation reasons, brand, region.

üëâ Built a star schema model in Power BI linking facts (orders) with dimensions (customer, date, channel).

### 3. Dashboard Design

The solution includes three integrated dashboards with filters:

üîπ In Full Orders Overview

KPIs: Total orders, In Full Orders, Fulfillment Rate (%).

Trend: Orders vs In Full orders by month.

Breakdown: By channel, customer group, region.

Customer detail: Current vs previous month comparison.

üîπ Partial Orders Overview

KPIs: Total Partial Orders, % Rate.

Trend: Partial orders over months.

Breakdown: By channel.

Top 5 customer groups with partial orders.

Drilldown: Customer-level analysis.

üîπ Cancelled Orders Overview

KPIs: Cancelled orders (quantity & amount), % cancellation rate.

Trend: Cancelled orders by month.

Breakdown: By channel.

Top 5 cancellation reasons.

### 4. Key Insights
